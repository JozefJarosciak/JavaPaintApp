GitHub URL: https://github.com/JozefJarosciak/JavaPaintApp

# Functionality:
* The user is able to select a colour of an object outline using color picker.
* The user is able to select a colour to be filled into an object using color picker.
* The user is able to select an object to draw from combo box.
* The object should be drawn in a continuous motion of the mouse; dragging will set the size of the shape. 
* For instance, when the user presses a button, the program captures the first coordinate, and on the release of mouse, the shape is drawn on the interface. While the user is moving mouse when the button is already down, the interface should show the updated shape.
* Supported 7 Shapes:  Line, Circle, Oval, Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Square, Triangle.
* Future Addons to consider: Eraser, Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste and others. 

# Requirements
